# CFRM505
Assignment code of CFRM505 Monte Carlo Methods In Finance at the University of Washington
# Course Desciption
Simulation of models of equity and fixed-income markets applied to financial applications, including derivative security pricing and risk management. The course will begin with a rapid review of probability distributions, statistics, and generating random numbers and samples from specified distributions.  The following topics will be covered:

Generating random variables: inverse transform method, composition method, & acceptance-rejection method. Generating correlated random variables: correlated normal & copula method

Simulating stochastic processes, including Brownian motions, Poisson Process, stochastic differential equations, jump-diffusion processes;

Simulation output analysis;

Major variance reduction techniques: control variates, antithetics, conditional Monte Carlo, stratified sampling, and importance sampling;

Pricing of financial derivatives, including European, American, and exotic derivatives;

Price sensitivity (Greeks) estimation;

Risk estimation via simulation, e.g. loss probability, value at risk & risk measures, as well as credit portfolio default risks;

Simulation methods for trading
